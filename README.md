TASK- 2

NUMBER GUESSING GAME

There are a total of 'totalRounds' rounds in the game, which in this example is set to 3. A random number in the ranges of 1 and 100 is created for each round, and the user is then asked to make an estimate. There is a cap on the number of tries, which is maxAttempts.
Users gain scores according to the quantity of attempts if they correctly predict the number within the allotted attempts. The attempts are deducted from the maximum tries, and one is added, to determine the points.

The ultimate score is shown once every round is finished.

To play the "Guess the Number" game with the extra features, compile and run this Java programme. Feel free to change the totalRounds, maxAttempts, and minimum Range and maximum Range to adjust the gameplay as desired parameters.
